# README

## Overview
This repository contains documentation related to UE initial access, scheduling mechanisms, and RRC procedures in 5G networks. These documents provide insights into scheduling strategies, UE capabilities, and timing considerations.

## File Descriptions

- **OAI UE Initial Access Trace Record.md** - Records and analysis of UE initial access in OAI.
- **OSC - Final scheduling.md** - Documentation on the final scheduling process in OSC.
- **OSC - Intra-slice scheduling.md** - Explanation of intra-slice scheduling mechanisms in OSC.
- **OSC - schSliceBasedDlScheduling.md** - Detailed description of slice-based downlink scheduling in OSC.
- **RRC Procedure.md** - Overview of the Radio Resource Control (RRC) procedure in 5G.
- **Schedule UL (new & retx).tw.md** - Uplink scheduling strategies, including new transmission and retransmission handling.
- **Timing window(中文).md** - Explanation of timing window concepts in Chinese.
- **UE Capability.md** - Documentation of UE capabilities and related configurations.

## Usage
These documents are intended for researchers, developers, and engineers working on 5G scheduling and UE management. The information can be used for:
- Understanding UE access and scheduling algorithms
- Analyzing intra-slice and inter-slice scheduling
- Studying the RRC procedure and UE capabilities
- Reviewing timing constraints and uplink scheduling mechanisms
